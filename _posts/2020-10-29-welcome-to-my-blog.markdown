Welcome to my blog, hopefully it will soon be home to some things that I consider interesting and worth sharing.

Most of the things on here will be loosley related to macs & managing them. Feel free to contact me about any things on here through the <a target="_blank" href="https://MACadmins.org">MacAdmins slack</a> (I'm Ewan on there).

Outside of work I'm a big outdoors person, who is mainly into kayaking, but will also venture out climbing, cycling/mountain biking and climbing! Hit me up if your in the south west of England (around Bristol/Bath) and want to meet up :)
